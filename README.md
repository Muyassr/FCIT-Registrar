# FCIT-Registrar
course registration system for FCIT CS Department <br><br>
<b>Objective:</b> 
Practice all concepts from CPCS-202 and CPCS-203, with a focus on making classes and creating objects from these classes. Specifically, you will practice making an array of objects and manipulating/using the data inside the array. Finally, and VERY important is that this program requires you to read from a file and write to a file (practice with File I/O). This is very important because all programs during the semester will use File I/O.


the aim is to create a basic course registration system for FCIT CS Department. This system will allow students to register for courses and will keep track of all students, all courses, and all registrations.
